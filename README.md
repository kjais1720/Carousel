# Carousel
# It's a carousel which can contain anything, text, testimonials, images etc. 
# It has some basic functionalities such as previous & next buttons to go to the previous or next slide respectively.
# It has bottom toggle buttons. Clicking on any such button will bring the corresponding slide.
# It is an infinite carousel, so the slides keep on changing unless the mouse hovers over the container. On hover, the carousel pauses and when the mouse leaves the container, it starts again.
